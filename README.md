```lrc
[00:09.17] Behold of this radiant might
[00:11.35] That'll be burning bright
[00:13.36] To the day, to the night
[00:25.36] 
[00:18.00] In majesty, with a blade of steel
[00:21.57] The warrior maiden awakens free
[00:25.23] From joust to joust to outshine the dark
[00:28.90] The crown's resolve is a fiery spark
[00:46.90] 
[00:32.78] In unity, our spirits soar
[00:36.35] And loyalty reigns forevermore
[00:40.02] From blow to blow, with head held high
[00:43.70] Against all odds, I'll never shy
[00:59.70] 
[00:47.85] In battle's wake, I stand tall
[00:51.31] Singing the clarion call
[00:54.67] Legends never die
[01:03.17] 
[00:58.61] Each sword is a flash, each shield a rock
[01:02.36] Each arrow's a clock that clocks on to crash
[01:06.28] The coup de grâce be dealt by a knight
[01:09.89] Who valiantly battles in soft moonlight
[01:29.39] 
[01:19.37] Through shadow's embrace
[01:22.80] The poison dance
[01:26.63] In disgrace, falls
[01:30.31] Taken away in a trance
[01:41.31] 
[01:37.51] Elegantly, holding hope aglow
[01:41.08] The kingdom's keeper shall overthrow
[01:44.70] The clouds and clouds of the monstrousness
[01:48.45] That believe to sit enthroned in absoluteness
[02:10.95] 
[01:52.35] Preciously, we'll defend our dreams
[01:55.85] Till the sun sheds its final beams
[01:59.55] And step by step, with our hearts aligned
[02:03.18] Against all odds, we'll stay resigned
[02:21.68] 
[02:07.12] In battle's place, I stand tall
[02:10.82] True to the clarion call
[02:14.33] Echoing the morning sky
[02:25.83] 
[02:19.88] Each sword is a flash, each shield a rock
[02:23.43] Each arrow's a clock that clocks on to crash
[02:27.40] The coup de grâce be dealt by a knight
[02:30.92] Who valiantly fights in the sunlight
[02:48.92] 
[02:34.94] Glory's a ride on the stage of decay
[02:38.28] And fate is a play that plays on pride
[02:42.17] The coup de grâce be dealt by a knight
[02:45.65] Who valiantly fights in the starlight
[03:04.15] 
[02:51.69] At battle's end, I stand tall
[02:55.23] I am the clarion call
[02:58.67] Echoing the morning sky
